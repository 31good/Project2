Canopus III - Low Poly Sci-Fi Desert Units Set

Units and building models share the same uv-map coordinates.
Environment models such as cliffs and rocks share the same uv-map coordinates.

The included Photoshop workfiles contain layers indicating the uv-mapping, so new diffuse maps with different colours can be easily created.

The models do not contain any animation tracks.
